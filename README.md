Landing page for oer bookr website. It is fully responsive in mobile, tablet and desktop modes.

The user is redirected to the react site that the front end architect created by clicking the sign up, log in or search here buttons.

Bootstrap was implemented to create a sticky navbar that allowed for a dropdown menu in mobile and tablet mode.

Two carousels were implemented. One is randomly picks an image from a predefined list of images to act as the background for the header. The other allows for the user to click through the top four books in the top books and new books section of the pg. Note the latter carousel is only implemented in the desktop mode.

Jquery was used to provide a bounce animation to the book categories and a shake animation to the social media icons.
